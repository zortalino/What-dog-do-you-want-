Filter lists and randomly suggest a dog according to the size desired by the user
Display an image of the dog that was suggested to give the user a visual example
Give the user more context by incorporating one more column of data from the CSV (Ex. Characteristics of breed, life span, traits, etc...)

I hope to add in more prompts for a user to be more selective with the kind of dog they want

This code also has extra comments from the class I was in
